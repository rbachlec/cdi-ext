{"name":"cdi-ext","tagline":"Some extensions for CDI","body":"# cdi-ext - Some extensions for CDI\r\n\r\nHere I would like to describe the features of my tiny cdi-ext library and how you could use them in your project.\r\n\r\nThe main features are:\r\n  - FactoryExtension: To be used if producer methods are not sufficient\r\n  - DisposableSingleton: Works like ApplicationScoped beans but beans can be disposed manually\r\n  - AnnotationUtil: Query annotations on AnnotatedType instances\r\n  - BeanManagerUtil: Get contextual instances and inject things in unmanaged beans\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# FactoryExtension\r\n\r\nThe reason for this CDI extension is the lack of generic producer methods in CDI. You can define qualifiers to call different producer methods on instantiation but you cannot write a producer method responsible for the instantiation of different classes (even if they should be created in the same way).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Create a factory by implementing the Factory interface.\r\n2. Annotate classes to be created by the factory with @ProducedByFactory.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# DisposableSingleton scope\r\n\r\nYou need singletons in your CDI application (like ApplicationScoped beans) but you want to drop them at times? Then this extension is the right thing for you.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Annotate your singletons with @DisposableSingleton.\r\n2. You can drop the singleton from the context by injecting the DisposableSingletonContext and call the disposeSingleton() method.\r\n3. But be careful: Already injected instances are not replaced automatically with a new instance on usage.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013 Roland Bachlechner\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
